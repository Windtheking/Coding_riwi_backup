## **Personal Portfolio Website - Santiago Andr√©s Mendoza**

# *This project is a personal portfolio website built using HTML and CSS. The main goal is to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information in a clean and organized layout.*

# Structure:
-----------
- The website uses a semantic HTML5 structure, including <header>, <main>, <section>, and <footer> tags for better readability and accessibility.
- The header contains my name, a short description, and a navigation bar with anchor links to different sections of the page.
- The main area is divided into several sections:
    - A profile picture (pfp) area.
    - An "About Me" section describing my background and skills.
    - A "Projects" section with images and descriptions of my work.
    - A table listing project details and technologies used.
    - A contact form for visitors to send messages.
- The footer includes links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, as well as a "Back to the Top" link.

# Styling:
---------
- Custom fonts are imported from Google Fonts for a unique look.
- Colors are chosen for a professional and modern appearance, with a mix of dark blue, light blue, and white backgrounds.
- Interactive elements like navigation links and buttons have hover effects for better user experience.
- The layout adapts to different screen sizes using relative units (vh, %) and flexible containers.

# Notes:
-------
- All images and assets are stored in the "assets" folder.
- The code is organized for readability, with clear class and ID names.
- This project demonstrates my ability to create a visually appealing and functional portfolio using only HTML and CSS.
